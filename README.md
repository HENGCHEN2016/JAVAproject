# JAVAproject
using Java programming language and Network technetronic knowledge to implement a simple application for connecting a source computer with another destination computer.
 
computer1 and computer2 should have four properties which are IP address , MAC address ,Subnet Mask and Default Gateway. ARP Table should be created.(put IP to change to phycial address. ) computer1 can connect computer2 because of Ping function.

There is a simple simulation:
